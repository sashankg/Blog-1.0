# Blog 1.0
Ruby on Rails personal blog

## Background
As I was learning Ruby, I wanted to build an application. I had heard a lot about Ruby on Rails, and was interested to see how it worked. I built a blog from scratch, and I learned a lot about not just how to use Ruby, but also about programming for the web.
